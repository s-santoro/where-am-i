# Where am I?

This project is inspired by [GeoGuessr](https://geoguessr.com/).

A web-application where you start somewhere on the globe and have to guess your position.
By clicking yourself through the street-view you can gain more insight about your position and
finally set your expected position on a world map.
As soon as you click "Evaluate", it shows the correct Position and the Distance between.

There is also the possibility to sign up and login, so you can track your previous games and get famous on the highscore board.
